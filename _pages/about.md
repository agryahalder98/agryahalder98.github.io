<span class="small_font"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I am <b>Agrya</b>, a Research Personnel in the Bioinformatics Lab of Machine Intelligence Unit (MIU) at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata, advised by Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isical.ac.in/~sanghami/">Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay</a> and [Dr. Abhik Ghosh](https://www.isical.ac.in/~abhik.ghosh/). My research is supported by <b>J C Bose Fellowship</b>. 

<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Prior</b>. I was also a <b>Senior Research Fellow</b> in the Dept. of Computer Sc. and Engg. at <b>Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi</b>. My research was focused on building advanced video surveillance algorithms and tracking models in the area of Computer Vision like Multi-Object Tracking, Image De-identification, and Video Prediction. My research was supported by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.serbonline.in/SERB/HomePage">SERB Core Research Fellowship</a> in Image and Video Processing of Machine Learning.

<!-- I received a Master degree in Computer Science from [Banaras Hindu University](https://www.bhu.ac.in/) in 2020 and Bachelor degree with Honours from [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/) in 2018. During 2021-22, I also worked as a Data Science Intern at [Sciffer Analytics](https://www.sciffer.com/). -->

Research Interest
=====

<span class="small_font">My interest lies at the intersection of <b>Multi-Object Tracking models and Image De-identification</b>. Specifically, I am interested in designing improved and advanced algorithms in the world of video surveillance to enable individuals being tracked while obfuscating their privacy preserving identities. This way, a person can be de-identified in control manner while achieving a greater frame-to-frame tracking performance. <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Today, identity of subjects gets disclosed in videos captured by surveillance cameras without their consent. But they are limiting in many ways - they are high dimensional, discrete, and, most importantly, incomplete -- they do not sense the underlying structure and only capture explicit values at specific locations. I am more interested in <b>implicit representations</b> of the world and how to design improved task-specific representations. Ultimately,My research focuses on building advanced video surveillance algorithms and tracking models in the area of [Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) like Multi-Object Tracking, Image De-identification, and Video Prediction!</span>
